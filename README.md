# NetworkCheckersServer

This is the server to [Network Checkers Client](https://github.com/Crichmond21/Network-Checkers-Client). Most relavant information will be updated on the Client page. This server contains the actual game rules and gameboard and the clients update from information sent by this server. A compiled version of this server is included with the client but this is the most up to date version. 

## Long-Term Goal
 
 Create an AI to have a single player mode in the game. Have this integrated into the server and an option on start up for this AI to be enabled.
